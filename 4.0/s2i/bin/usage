This is a S2I Swift builder image that can turn Swift source code into built applications contained 
in docker images.  The purpose here being that you don't have to write your own Dockerfiles.  And 
you can leverage this for better consistency across your development environment.
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image#installation

Sample invocation to build a test app using this image:
$ s2i build ./3.0/test/test-app/ dudash/swift-30-ubuntu14 swift-test-app
(Note: replace the version and OS as appropiate for the image you are using)

The above will have created an image containing your app, so you can then run your app via:
$ docker run swift-test-app
